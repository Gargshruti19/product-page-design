# Product Page Design

This repository contains a simple HTML and CSS code for creating a product page design. The product page is designed for showcasing a casual T-shirt and allows users to select various options like size, color, and quantity before making a purchase.

## Project Overview

The product page is a single HTML file that includes the following sections:

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML file defines the structure of the product page, including details about the product such as its name, price, discount, and description. It also allows users to select the size, color, and quantity of the product.

- **Image Gallery**: The product page features an image gallery with a main product image and controls to switch between different product images.

- **Product Options**: Users can choose from a range of options, including selecting the product's size and color. The available options are displayed using radio buttons and labels for user-friendly selection.

- **Buy Now Button**: The "Buy Now" button is provided at the bottom of the form to allow users to proceed with the purchase.

- **JavaScript Interaction**: The JavaScript code at the end of the HTML file enables users to interact with the image gallery. When a user clicks on the control buttons, the main product image changes accordingly.

## Styles and Design

The CSS styles define the layout and visual design of the product page. Some key design features include:

- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- A color scheme that combines a light background for product details and a darker background for the image gallery.
- Stylish form elements for selecting size, color, and quantity.
- Interactive control buttons in the image gallery.

## How to Use

To use this code, simply copy and paste the HTML and CSS into your project. You can customize the product details, images, and styles to match your specific needs. The included JavaScript code for the image gallery interaction can also be adapted for different products.
